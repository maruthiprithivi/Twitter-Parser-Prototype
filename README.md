# Twitter-Parser-Prototype

A basic prototype parser wirtten in python to parse twitter data which is in csv format to tweets, rt and replies...

The parser works on small heuristics set, so there are lots of room for improvemnts...

Feel free to work on the codes and make changes to it...

The parser was solely written to learn and test... ;)
